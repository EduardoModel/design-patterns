# The Constructor Pattern
This pattern is very usefull to encapsulate all the object creation login inside one entity;

This entity will take care to initialize some of the required values and is also able to recieve
arguments to populate the new created object as well;

And following the Single Responsability Principle ([SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)), a constructor
should be able to create only a specific type of object;

To run the example just type `yarn constructor` or `npm run constructor`;
