# The Singleton Pattern
The Singleton Pattern is very useful when one and only one instance of an object is needed during the
whole execution of the script;

A very good example for this pattern is for a connection with a database or to make the same resource easy to access through the whole program;

To run the example just type `yarn singleton` or `npm run singleton`;
