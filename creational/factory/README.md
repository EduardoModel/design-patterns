# The Factory Pattern
As the name of this pattern already implies is that it is responsible to centralize the complexity of
creation from different objects that share a common group, for example vehicles or users with different roles;

The big advantage of this pattern is that gives the developer the possibility to choose between the available factories
to instantiate an object that suits at most the necessities;

Another one is that because all the objects are created inside a factory, if a definition or a paramether change, it just need to be done in one place;

To run the example just type `yarn factory` or `npm run factory`;
