# Creational Patterns

Following the definition of the book [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns from Addy Osmani (O'REILLY)](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/):
> Creational design patterns focus on handling object-creation mechanisms where objects are
> created in a manner suitable for a given situation.
> The basic approach to object creation might otherwise lead to added complexity in a project, while these patterns aim to solve this problem by *controlling* the creation process.

In a nutshell, these patterns helps to guide the creation of objects depending of the current scenario;

Examples of Creational Patterns are:
- [**Constructor**](/creational/constructor)
- [**Module**](/creational/module)
- [**Factory**](/creational//factory)
- [**Abstract Prototype**](/creational//abstract)
- [**Singleton**](/creational//singleton)
- [**Builder**](/creational//builder)
