# The Prototype Pattern
This pattern is in a nutshel just like the [mitosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitosis) for a cell;

This pattern avoids the creation of another classes because the new created objects are just copies of another one that is serving as a teamplate (prototype); Another big advantage is that the functions defined inside the objects are all created by reference, i.e. that all derivated objects utilizes the original functions and thus doesn't create new instances from them;

To run the example just type `yarn prototype` or `npm run prototype`;
