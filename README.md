# Design Patterns - A reduced and to fast to consult repository
**Design Patterns** are solutions to common problems in software design.

Following the description from the book [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns from Addy Osmani (O'REILLY)](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/):
> A pattern is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design(...).
> Another way of looking at patterns is as templates for how we solve problems - ones that can be used in quite a few different situations.

The main advantage of the design patterns is to define a common language between developers that helps to communicate more efficiently.

### Categories
Design Patterns can be described into three categories:

[**Creational Patterns**](/creational):
These patterns provide different mechanisms to create objects and thus increasing the flexibility and the reusability of the
code that was written.

[**Structural Patterns**](/structural):
These patterns help to combine the different objects and classes inside a bigger picture while keeping the code structure flexible and effcient, allowing actions like integration and refactoring to be done more easily.


[**Behavioral Patterns**](/behavioral):
At least but not less important are the behavioral patterns. They help the different parts of a program to communicate with themselves more efficiently and to assign responsibility/tasks to the parts.
