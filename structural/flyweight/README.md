# The Flyweight Pattern
The Flyweight Pattern aims to optimize code that is repetitive, inefficient and slow at sharing data.
This pattern helps to fit more objects inside the available RAM space by sharing common values/functions between the objects without the need to instantiate the same resources multiple times;

One hint on where to utilize this pattern is when is possible to notice that some attributes ares imilar and shared between a loot of other elements where a reference to those values is much more practical than to save the same value multiple times in different objects;
