# The Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern allows to add new capabilities dynamically to an existing object utilizing wrappers that encapsulates those new behaviours;

This solution is like inheritance but the focus shifted from the objects themselves to the capabilities/functionalities that can be aggregated into an object, avoiding the necessity to write different classes to cover all the possible combinations;

And the approach to add these new features is basically to instantiate new objects utilizing the existing ones to add the extra capabilities on top of them;

To run the example just type `yarn decorator` or `npm run decorator`;
