# Structural Patterns

Following the definition of the book [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns from Addy Osmani (O'REILLY)](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/):
> Structural patterns are concerned with object composition and typically identify simple ways to realize relationships
> between different objects. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system
> doesn't need to do the same. (...)

In a nutshell, this patterns develop a commmunication layer between the parts and insert a an abstraction layer so the
system sees only black boxes with a specified interface to communicate with them.

Example of Strucural Patterns:
- [**Decorator**](/structural/decorator)
- [**Facade**](/structural/facade)
- [**Flyweight**](/structural/flyweight)
- [**Adapter**](/structural/adapter)
- [**Proxy**](/structural/proxy)
