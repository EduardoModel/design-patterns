# The Mediator Pattern
The Mediator Pattern resembles a lot like the Publish/Subscribe pattern with an extra quirk that is to guarantees that all the parts will be notified about new information, whereas the Publish/Subscribe doesn't ensure that;

In reality this patter is basicaly the Observer Pattern with a shared Subject;

For a better understanding of this patter I highly recomment this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOVc5o5kURE) from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ);

To run the example just type `yarn mediator` or `npm run mediator`;

To see the code just click [here](/behavioral/mediator/example.js);
