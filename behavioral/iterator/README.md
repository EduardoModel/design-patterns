# The Iterator Pattern
The Iterator Pattern is very useful when a specific or complex structure needs to be iterated in a specific way, for example, a [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree) can be traversed in different ways such as inorder, preorder or postorder (More about in this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal));

A recommendation for this pattern is that it should be used for complex data structure and not for trivial ones, like an array for example;

To run the example just type `yarn iterator` or `npm run iterator`;
