Following the definition of the book [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns from Addy Osmani (O'REILLY)](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/):
> Behavioral patterns focus on improving the streamlining of the communication between disparate objects in a
> system.

Examples of Behavioral Patterns are:
- [**Iterator**](/behavioral/iterator)
- [**Mediator**](/behavioral/mediator)
