# The Observer Pattern
The Observer Pattern provides a way to establish communication between objects that are listening (observers) and a subject
that has a list of observers. As soon as his context changes, it will notify all the observers inside the list with the new context;

This pattern provides a very low coupling level between the involved parts. This guarantee a loot of autonomy for the observers themselves because if they don't want to listen about changes of a specific subject, it can simply detach themselves;
The other case is valid, when an observer wants to listen about changes of a channel, it can register himself within the desired subject;

To run the example just type `yarn observer` or `npm run observer`;
